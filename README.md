# Motivations
I made OpenCron as a basic exercise to understand how cron-style scheduling systems work. OpenScheduler is an in-memory job scheduler that lets you schedule tasks either once (after a delay) or on a repeating interval. Itâ€™s inspired by how systems like cron, Celery Beat, or distributed job queues manage delayed and recurring job execution.

Tasks are stored in-memory and run asynchronously (in the background) using goroutines. For recurring jobs, OpenScheduler will requeue the task at the specified interval. For one-time jobs, it deletes the task after execution. Thread-safety is ensured with mutexes, so the scheduler is safe for concurrent usage. All jobs are checked every single second for execution eligibility based on the current time.
